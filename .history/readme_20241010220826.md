## README for Game Tracker CLI Application

### Overview
The **Game Tracker CLI Application** is designed to manage your gaming collection by syncing games from your Steam account, keeping track of your gameplay hours, and recording the status of each game (Backlog, Playing, Done). Additionally, the app integrates with the **HowLongToBeat** service to search for game completion times. This application is built with Python and leverages PostgreSQL for database management.

### Features
- **Steam Game Sync**: Automatically fetches owned games from your Steam account, tracks playtime, and stores the information in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Game Management**: Add new games manually, view your games by status, and update game statuses.
- **HowLongToBeat Integration**: Search for game completion times using the HowLongToBeat service.
- **Data Export**: Ability to export game data to a CSV file for external analysis.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: User-friendly CLI for managing and interacting with your game collection.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Steam API Key
- HowLongToBeat API (unofficial Python package)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  ```bash
  pip install requests sqlalchemy howlongtobeatpy
  ```

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-tracker.git
   cd game-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `requests`, `SQLAlchemy`, and `howlongtobeatpy` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL**:
   Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection in `config.py`.

4. **Configure the Steam API**:
   - Obtain your Steam API key [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
   - Add your Steam API key and user ID to `config.py`:
     ```python
     STEAM_API_KEY = 'your_steam_api_key'
     STEAM_USER_ID = 'your_steam_user_id'
     ```

5. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main script to launch the CLI application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Application Structure
- **main.py**: The entry point of the application, contains the main menu logic and handles user interaction.
- **models.py**: Defines the database models for the games stored in PostgreSQL.
- **config.py**: Stores configuration data such as API keys and database connection strings.

### Features to be Implemented
- **Game Completion Percentage**: Calculate and display the percentage of game completion based on HowLongToBeat data.
- **Game Search and Database Integration**: Add a way to search for a game on HowLongToBeat, check if it already exists in the database, and optionally add it.
- **CSV Import/Export**: Save game data to a CSV file and load it later or export data for analysis in tools like Excel.
- **Django Web Interface**: Convert the app into a Django web application to provide a more accessible user interface.

### Usage
Upon running the application, youâ€™ll be presented with a menu with the following options:
1. **Sync Games from Steam**: Pulls game data from your Steam account and updates your local database.
2. **Add a New Game**: Manually adds a new game to your collection.
3. **Display Games by Status**: View your game collection filtered by status (Backlog, Playing, Done).
4. **Update Game Status**: Modify the status of a specific game in your collection.
5. **How Long To Beat (Testing)**: Searches for game completion times on HowLongToBeat.
6. **Exit**: Closes the application.

### Known Issues
- Currently, the app does not have exception handling for network errors while fetching Steam data.
- The HowLongToBeat integration is still in testing and may not return accurate results for all games.
- No error handling for invalid input in CLI.

### Future Enhancements
- Add a feature to calculate and display the percentage of game completion based on HowLongToBeat data.
- Implement better error handling for API calls and invalid input.
- Add pagination for large game collections in the display functions.
- Build a web interface with Django for easier interaction and game management.
